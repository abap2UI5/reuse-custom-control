## What this repository is

The source of the npm package **`@abap2ui5/reuse-custom-control`**
(`packages/reuse-custom-control`): the UI5 custom control
`z2ui5.reuse.Container`, which runs an abap2UI5 app - an ABAP class
implementing `z2ui5_if_app` - inside any UI5 app. Next to it an example app
(`examples/host-app`) that consumes the package the way an app from the
registry would, and Playwright tests (`test/e2e`) that drive that example
against a live abap2UI5 backend.

**Language:** English for all code, comments, docs, commit messages, PRs.

## The package is the control and nothing else

The abap2UI5 frontend - the `z2ui5` UI5 component the control wraps - is
**not** part of this repository or the package. The control loads it at run
time from the abap2UI5 service it talks to
(`GET <endpoint>?z2ui5-bundle`, answered by `z2ui5_cl_ui5_http_handler` from
the generated `z2ui5_cl_ui5f_preload`; its only source is
[abap2UI5 `app/webapp`](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5/tree/main/app/webapp)).

- Never vendor, copy or pin the frontend here, and add nothing to the package
  that has to follow abap2UI5's releases.
- A change the control needs from the frontend (an embedded mode, a new
  `componentData` setting, ...) is a pull request to abap2UI5. Do not work
  around a frontend limitation in the control when the fix belongs there -
  say so instead.
- Nothing is deployed to an ABAP system for the control: it is a plain
  module (no component, no library, no manifest), so it never takes an app
  index entry, and any number of apps carry their own copy.

## Layout

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `packages/reuse-custom-control/src/` | The control (`Container.js`) and its stylesheet |
| `packages/reuse-custom-control/ui5.yaml` | UI5 CLI project of type `module`: `/thirdparty/z2ui5/reuse/` → `src/` |
| `packages/reuse-custom-control/README.md` | The consumer documentation - what npm shows |
| `examples/host-app/` | The example: a plain UI5 app, `includeDependency` and the `z2ui5.reuse` resourceRoot, `ui5-middleware-simpleproxy` to the backend, `lib/sameOrigin.js` for the backend's CSRF check |
| `test/e2e/` | Playwright tests of the example |
| `.github/workflows/` | `ci.yaml` (checks, consumer build, e2e against abap2UI5's default branch), `publish.yaml` (npm, on a GitHub release) |

## Rules for `src/`

- **UI5 1.71 is the floor**, as in abap2UI5. Use no module, class, property or
  enum newer than 1.71, and no `sap/ui/core/Lib` / `sap/ui/core/Element`
  static APIs. What the control uses today and since when:
  `sap/ui/dom/includeStylesheet` (1.58), `ComponentContainer#lifecycle`
  (1.56), renderer `apiVersion: 2` (1.67).
  The e2e tests run the example on 1.71 too (`examples/host-app/ui5-1.71.yaml`,
  the `ui5-1.71` Playwright project) - a change to `src/` is done when both
  projects pass.
- **Keep the control thin.** It picks the class, the endpoint and the size;
  everything the app does comes from the backend through the component. It
  configures the component only through what the frontend reads itself -
  `componentData` (abap2UI5 `Component.init`), filled from the bundle's
  `z2ui5/embed` module plus `startupParameters` and `endpoint` - never by
  patching the manifest or reaching into the component's state.
- **The bundle is code - load it only from a path on this server.** Keep the
  `SAME_ORIGIN_PATH` check: an `endpoint` with a scheme, `//host` or a
  backslash is refused before anything is requested. Load it with a
  `<script src>`, never with `eval`, `new Function` or `fetch` + inject.
- **One frontend per page, one component per control, one backend session per
  component.** The bundle is loaded once; a change of `app`, `endpoint` or
  `params` replaces the component; nothing is patched into a running one.
- **`thirdparty/`, not `resources/`.** An app deployed to an ABAP system
  answers every `<app>/resources/` path from the system's UI5; the control is
  served and built under `thirdparty/z2ui5/reuse/` and registered with a
  relative resourceRoot. Keep `ui5.yaml`, the consumer README and the
  example's `manifest.json` in step.
- **No inline styles for descendants and no `eval`**: a host with a strict
  Content-Security-Policy must need nothing extra. Styles go into
  `Container.css`, scoped under `.z2ui5ReuseContainer`.
- A UI5 module id is case-sensitive and a wrong one only fails in the browser
  (`includeStylesheet`, not `includeStyleSheet`) - run the e2e tests.

## Validation

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint && npm run format:check
npm run build          # ui5 build of the example - the control lands in dist/thirdparty/
npm run pack:check     # package contents: ui5.yaml and src/ only
npx playwright test    # needs an abap2UI5 backend with ?z2ui5-bundle on :3000 - see README
```

All text files are LF-only, formatted with Prettier (`.prettierrc`).

## Publishing

A GitHub release `v<version>` publishes the version in
`packages/reuse-custom-control/package.json` (`publish.yaml`, `NPM_TOKEN`).
